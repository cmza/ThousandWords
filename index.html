<p><em>A node-linked Visual Creator Application supporting builtin nodes, scripted nodes, live nodes and more.</em></p>

<p>The underlying reason is to keep a simple-to-read library of graphics code. For that reason I strongly suggest you pattern your nodes on the examples, and don't obfuscate your code.  Don't provide only binaries (you'd have to modify the core to do that). Don't charge, if you can resist the urge.</p>

<p>For example, an input node could have a cat picture. The output from that node might be fed into a script node to create a very specific effect.  The output from the script node could be set to a frames node.  The frames node might link bank to one of the parameters in the effect (script) node, allowing it to adjust over time.</p>

<p>A possible related repo : An output node code generate <strong>Processing</strong> code, although that would require some sort of C# -&gt; Java transpiler.</p>

<p>If there's a <em>slow</em> but <strong>easy</strong> version of your plugin, and a <em>lightning-fast</em> but <strong>hard</strong> to read version, possibly include both, with a <strong>switch</strong> parameter.</p>
