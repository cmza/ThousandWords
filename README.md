# ThousandWords
ThousandWords is a environment for creating still or animated artwork; it offers visual composition, image processing, 3D modeling (of a sort), texture creation, etc. However, these tools are built using TW's collection of query-action nodes that can be edited in the Operator Chain windows, which is a linked-node editor.  

Anything can be linked to anything.  Most composition chains only allow a single traversal (an Acyclic Directed Tree) in ThousandWords, a sophisticated Cyclic Directed Tree etc...
